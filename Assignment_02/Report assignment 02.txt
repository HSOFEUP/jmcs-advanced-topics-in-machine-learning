1) 
Which optimizer works for your setting? Report the best reconstruction PSNR.

- The optimizer that works well is torch.optim.Adam. Better than e.g. torch.optim.SGD (according to a test run)

- the best reconstruction PSNR reported is: 14.7441 dB


2)
Report the best top-1 and top-5 accuracies that you obtain by training the network within 10 minutes.
- best top-1 accuracy: 85.2000 dB
- best top-5 accuracy: 99.1200 dB


3)
Report the best reconstruction PSNR and classification top-1 and top-5 accuracies. Do you get a higher performance? Justify your observation.

- the best reconstruction PSNR reported is: 16.4268 dB
- best top-1 accuracy: 89.7800 dB
- best top-5 accuracy: 99.5500 dB

The gain in performance happens thanks to the nonlinearity addition (ReLU) in the autoencoder and the 3 additional layers (linear, ReLU and dropout) in the linear classifier model. 
The addition of activation functions (i.e. ReLU layers) in the autoencoder architecture allows for better performance in the backpropagation process and therefore a better learning process. Put simplified, ReLU layers facilitate large and consistent gradients (if respective unit is active) which are more useful for learning.



4)
The final solution (including all the changes made for 3)) reaches a top-1 accuracy of 89.78%. The trained model of that performance was persisted and is attached in the file 'trained_autoencoder.pt'. The program can be run and it will pick up that model automatically if it resides in same directory as the source file.
